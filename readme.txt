== Description ==
The Fusion Base is a blank-canvas theme that is designed to work hand in hand with the [Fusion](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fusion/) plugin. The post and page templates use the entire browser window for post content output, meaning every aspect of your page is controlled by Fusion. This makes for limitless possibilities when it comes to the look and feel of your site.

The Fusion Base also adds a Layout page in the admin for building a Master Layout for your site. This allows you to add and arrange Components that are output above and/or below the post content on every post and page. This feature is most useful for building custom headers and footers that are easy to maintain from one location.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance -> Themes and click the 'Add New' button.
2. Type in Fusion Base in the search form and press the 'Enter' key on your keyboard.
3. Click on the 'Activate' button to use your new theme right away.
4. Download and install the [Fusion](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fusion/) plugin to get the most out of the Fusion Base theme.
5. Read about using Components in the [Fusion User guide](http://agencydominion.helpscoutdocs.com/article/16-reusable-layout-components)
